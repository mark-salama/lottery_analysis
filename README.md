# Lottery Analysis

Found a website (lottoreport.com) which showed total Powerball and Mega Millions sales by state by lottery draw. I have always been interested in the lottery, and wanted to see what states these games were most popular. With some research I found that these high payout lottery games were but a fraction of total lottery sales. 

I used geopandas and state shape files povided on the census.gov website to build the graphics.
